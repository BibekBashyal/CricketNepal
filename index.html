Its current headquarters is in Kathmandu, Nepal. Cricket Association of Nepal is Nepal's representative at the International Cricket Council and is an associate member and has been a member of that body since 1988. It is also a member of the Asian Cricket Council. The association has selected Mahendra Singh Dhoni as their brand ambassador.
The board was dissolved by the government of Nepal in November 2014 on the grounds of incompetence and a three-member ad hoc committee was established with a new president designated by the government itself.<br><br>Despite unprecedented success on the field, including victories over Hong Kong and Afghanistan at the 2014 ICC World Twenty20, Nepal went through some turmoil off the field in 2014 with a boycott of the national one-day tournament by the national players with the captain Paras Khadka slamming the Cricket Association of Nepal for their treatment of national players.<br>
